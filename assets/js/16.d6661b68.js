This was acutely demonstrated for me a few weeks ago when I unfortunately hit a deer while driving to my summer house with parts of my family. My dad, still a strong and agile hunter at 72, ran after the poor animal to end its suffering while the rest of us stayed close to the car. It was dusk but I could well see my dad out on the field doing the grim reaping, but only the outline of it. Nuances were gone, the scene reduced to a few levels of gray.

We will gradually lose our vision, no matter what we do. Not necessarily resolution, but definitely the ability to see in low-contrast situations. As you grow older you will need more and more light to get the same amount of information from a certain view. According to scientific reports, for every 13 years you need double amount of light to keep a certain level of visual information. Several factors come at play: the retina gradually loses its sensivity, the pupil shrinks from average 4.7 mm at age 20 to 2.3 mm at 80 so less light enters the eye, and colour vision changes as more blue light is absorbed by the pupil. These factors should be taken into consideration when designing things for the eyes, like web pages and applications for screen based devices.

You have to look very long for a comment of type "this just won\'t work because this-or-that".
